                Hello, my name is Petr, and I'm a 21-year-old computer science student. I have a passion for technology
                and I love exploring and learning new things in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my biggest hobbies is homelabbing, which involves building and configuring my own servers and
                networks at
                home. I enjoy working with tools such as <b>Proxmox</b>, <b><a href="#top7tools">Docker</a></b>, and <b>TrueNAS</b> to create
                unique and
                powerful computing
                environments. It's a great way to test and learn new skills while building something useful for myself
                and
                others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from technology, I also enjoy playing video games and reading about science fiction and fantasy.
                I'm
                always
                looking for new ways to challenge myself and learn, whether it's through a new programming language or a
                new
                strategy game.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I don't consider myself a <i>social butterfly</i>, I am always open to meeting new people who
                share my interests.
                If you're also into homelabbing or computer science, don't hesitate to drop me a message and we can
                chat!
            </p>
